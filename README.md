## What works

All basic calculator functionality is working, unit tests for the calculator methods
To run tests: `$ yarn test a`

### What doesn't / potential improvements

In no particular order:

- Shortening of recurring decimals
- Replace '*' and '/' button labelling with proper symbols
- Handling of negative numbers
- Better button layout
- Replacing CSS with Sass, better CSS overall, responsive CSS
- Add Enzyme tests for the button handlers
- More thorough unit tests for calculator methods
- Support for keyboard events
- Error handling for adding a second decimal to a number
- Support for follow on calculations after using the '=' key
- Additional methods eg percentages, square root etc.

### Time spent

Somewhere around 2.5 to 3 hours, more than planned but resolving javascript's unique handling of decimal calculations took a little time.
